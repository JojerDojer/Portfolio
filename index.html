            I'm John Davidson, a passionate and motivated junior web developer specializing in both front-end and back-end technologies.
            My journey into web development began in 2022 when I discovered a love for creating visually appealing and functionally robust
            websites. To further develop my skills, I enrolled at Bellevue University, where I received a comprehensive Full Stack development
            education, learning server-side programming, responsive web design, database management, and single-page application development.
          </p>

          <p>
            I've gained hands-on experience with technologies like HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Node.js, and Express, which have equipped me to
            build user-friendly applications. As a junior developer, I'm eager to continue learning and applying my skills in real-world environments.
            I am enthusiastic about joining a forward-thinking company where I can contribute to innovative projects while growing as a professional
            and helping drive business success.
